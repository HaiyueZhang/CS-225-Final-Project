### Comments
A very well-written proposal overall, and it is great to see plans in the leading question to add further to the project if time permits.

**Leading Question**
The leading question is succint, and understandable. Explains how the graph edges are weighted. 

**Dataset**
The dataset is well described and the intuition on the efficiency of runtime and storage are good (although we will see alternatives which are better in some contexts). The cleaning stages are also well explained.

**Algorithm**
The algorithms are clearly specified. The ranking of cities however is not very clear, how/why it is pertinent to the leading question. Maybe I'm missing something? However, the goals specified by the leading question is addressed here so shall not deduct points.
