        - 10 hours per week.

        - This is the time the importance of collaboration and the spirit of Captain America show up. Everyone should be responsible to finish their workload on time. We will try to avoid these situations happening.

        - If they are late two times or more, we need to have a talk and avoid these situations happening again. 

    -  Are there other hypothetical situations that you as an individual or as a team want to discuss ahead of time?

        - If we face a time conflict, we will send a message to the rest of the teammates and decide on a new Meeting time.
